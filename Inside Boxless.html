    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1><br/>
    <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design,
        dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p><br/>
    <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries,
        although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction
        to the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>English estate gardens.</u></p><br/>
    <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,
        with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
